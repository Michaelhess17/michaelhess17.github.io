Hello world! My name is Michael Hess, and I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Emory University in Neuroscience. My research focuses on modeling of dynamical systems, primarily in the context of adaptive control of locomotion, but my research interests span many areas in biology, mathematics, physics, computational science, and machine learning.
