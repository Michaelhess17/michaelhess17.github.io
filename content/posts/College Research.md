# Research/Work Experiences Before Graduate School

## Introduction
I guess the first question I am asking myself while writing this is: who cares? This is the first real post I'm making on this website, so that question is still fresh on my mind, but despite the doubts, I do think it is worthwhile to document my research experiences while their details are still recent enough to recall in sufficient detail (and maybe even revisit to make visualizations or test new ideas along the way). Having some in-depth explanations of what I did at several points in my academic career will both help future employers get a sense of what kind of work I have done and will help me keep my thoughts organized and remember what all I have done! I am not a particularly forgetful person, but as you will see, my undergraduate years were full of experiences -- many of which are not worth putting on my CV, but still represented significant experiences in my academic growth. Having the space to talk about those more is exciting for me (since I never get to talk about them!) and hopefully exciting for possible employers that want to get a better understanding of how I have spent my time.

Though it's definitely not worth putting on my CV or discussing in detail here, it is worth prefacing this article by mentioning that I was also working real jobs outside of these positions. I got my first job at 14, lived on my own from 16, and continued working 80+ hour weeks up until moving to Atlanta to attend Emory. 

## High School
### Environmental Tree Ring Laboratory (Project SEED -- May-August 2016)
My research journey begins the summer before senior year of high school. While researching colleges, I found a summer research program sponsored by the American Chemical Society called Project SEED (Summer Experience for the Economically Disadvantaged) at a nearby university (Indiana University Bloomington). At this point, I had a vague interest in science, but I had no idea what field I wanted to study. Luckily, the program randomly assigned us laboratories to do research in over the summer, and I ended up in a laboratory I probably would not have considered: the Environmental Tree Ring laboratory, led by Justin Maxwell, Ph.D. Dr. Maxwell was just starting a very exciting project for which we traveled to a local historic village in Spring Mill State Park, took samples from the log cabins, and used the tree rings to determine when the tree was felled. The main idea behind our analysis was that the amount a tree grows (and thus the distance between tree rings) depends primarily on environmental factors like air quality, sun coverage, etc. which will be _relatively_ constant within a geographical area. We also took several samples from living trees in the area, and by measuring the distances between the tree rings in all the collected samples, we were able to align the samples from the log cabins to samples of living trees, allowing us to determine the last year that the tree grew.

Interestingly, the cabins were adorned with plaques with the "history" of the structure, but we found that these plaques suggested the cabins were before the trees were even cut down. Thus, the plaques were inaccurate, though I would be surprised if they have fashioned new signs yet. Less interestingly (but still interestingly!) we found that one of the structures had logs from a mixture of years. We looked into public, historical records from the village and found that the cabin dwellers had several children between the first construction and later addition, so we assume they must have just needed some more space!
