## Introduction
I guess the first question I am asking myself while writing this is: who cares? This is the first real post I'm making on this website, so that question is still fresh on my mind, but despite the doubts, I do think it is worthwhile to document my research experiences while their details are still recent enough to recall in sufficient detail (and maybe even revisit to make visualizations or test new ideas along the way). Having some in-depth explanations of what I did at several points in my academic career will both help future employers get a sense of what kind of work I have done and will help me keep my thoughts organized and remember what all I have done! I am not a particularly forgetful person, but as you will see, my undergraduate years were full of experiences -- many of which are not worth putting on my CV, but still represented significant experiences in my academic growth. Having the space to talk about those more is exciting for me (since I never get to talk about them!) and hopefully exciting for possible employers that want to get a better understanding of how I have spent my time.

Though it's definitely not worth putting on my CV or discussing in detail here, it is worth prefacing this article by mentioning that I was also working real jobs outside of these positions. I got my first job at 14, lived on my own from 16, and continued working 80+ hour weeks up until moving to Atlanta to attend Emory. 

## High School
### Environmental Tree Ring Laboratory 
#### Indiana University Project SEED -- May - August 2016
My research journey begins the summer before senior year of high school. While researching colleges, I found a summer research program sponsored by the American Chemical Society called Project SEED (Summer Experience for the Economically Disadvantaged) at a nearby university (Indiana University Bloomington). At this point, I had a vague interest in science, but I had no idea what field I wanted to study. Luckily, the program randomly assigned us laboratories to do research in over the summer, and I ended up in a laboratory I probably would not have considered: the Environmental Tree Ring laboratory, led by Justin Maxwell, Ph.D. Dr. Maxwell was just starting a very exciting project for which we traveled to a local historic village in Spring Mill State Park, took samples from the log cabins, and used the tree rings to determine when the tree was felled.

The main idea behind our analysis was that the amount a tree grows (and thus the distance between tree rings) depends primarily on environmental factors like air quality, sun coverage, etc. which will be _relatively_ constant within a geographical area. We also took several samples from living trees in the area, and by measuring the distances between the tree rings in all the collected samples, we were able to align the samples from the log cabins to samples of living trees, allowing us to determine the last year that the tree grew. Interestingly, the cabins had plaques with the "history" of the structure, but we found that these plaques suggested the cabins were constructed before the trees were even cut down! So, the plaques were inaccurate, but I wouldn't be surprised if they have not fashioned new signs yet! Less interestingly (but still interestingly!) we found that one of the structures had logs from a mixture of years. We looked into public, historical records from the village and found that the cabin dwellers had several children between the first construction and later addition, so we assume they must have just needed some more space!

### Lu Laboratory
#### Indiana University May 2016 - August 2017
Oddly enough, my main academic interest at this point was neuroscience and the Environmental Tree Ring laboratory happened to be in one of the main neuroscience buildings on IU's campus. After the summer project in the Environmental Tree Ring laboratory, I asked another investigator in the building if they would take a lab assistant through the school year. The researcher was Hui-Chen Lu, whose laboratory investigates the role of NMNAT2, a neuronal maintenance factor, in the progression of Alzheimer's Disease (or AD-like pathology in mice). They were hesitant to take a high school student, but accepted me on a trial basis and I began immediately. I had completed the requirements for my diploma before senior year, so I decided to attend class in the morning, drive the campus in the after lunch, and do laboratory work until ~5-6pm each day.

When I started in the laboratory, my only responsibilities were menial tasks like preparation of PBS solution, autoclaving the biohazardous waste, and cleaning of well plates. In between tasks, I read papers from the lab, attended weekly lab meetings, and observed exeriments happening in the lab. After a few months of work, I finally got to get my hands dirty -- unfortunately it was mainly doing mouse perfusions and whole brain fixation. This experience was a large part of the reason why I am now a theorist. The brutality of cutting the heart of a living, breathing thing, only to rip the skin off of its face, chip away at the skull and detach the brain was just too dark to make a casual part of my life. I understand the importance of animal research, and I am eternally grateful for the breakthroughs that have resulted from it, but personally, I will stick to cultured neurons, _C. elegans_, _Drosophila_, and simulations wherever possible.

After an extended period of making solutions, cleaning, and killing the mice, I started to get some real scientific responsibilties: namely brain sectioning with the vibratome, immunofluorescent antibody staining, slide fixation, and confocal imaging of the sections.

After some more time practicing sectioning, staining, and imaging, I finally got to take ownership of a project. I would investigate whether knocking out NMNAT2 lead to developmental changes in the mouse somatosensory cortex, specifically in the size of the "barrels". The mouse somatosensory cortex is highly structured around the whisker input, and the so-called "barrel" cortex is a sub-region in the somatosensory cortex that has a highly somatotopic representation of the whisker, with each of these blobs, or "barrels", receiving input from a separate whisker.

Investigating this area turned out to have a large learning curve. The barrel cortex is situated oblique to the coronal, saggital, and transverse orientations, so you have to manually slice off the cortical lobes at just the right angle to get good sections showing the whole barrel map. This took a good amount of practice to get right! After perfecting the technique with control mice, I moved on to the experimental mice, stained all the slices, and imaged them. Once I had processed all of the images, my project investigated whether the average fluorescence of FGFR (a receptor for the neuronal growth/development factor, Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)) changed in the knockout mice and whether the knockout mice had differently sized barrels overall. The results showed some trend, but nothing significant, and I had to go to Los Angeles to attend undergraduate, so I couldn't spend more time working on the project.
