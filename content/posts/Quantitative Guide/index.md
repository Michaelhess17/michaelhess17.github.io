## A Curated Guide to Learning Math, Coding, and Machine Learning
I am frequently asked for resources on quantitative topics since I am primarily self-taught in most of these areas. I decided a while back to put together this list of resources that I used when learning or that I am aware of. These are in no way comprehensive, but should serve as a good starting point for gaining intuition and interest in the subfields, and further learning will certainly be necessary before applying any of these ideas in a serious capacity.

### Mathematics and Statistics

#### Essence of Linear Algebra (3Blue1Brown)
- Provides a strong geometric foundation for linear algebra.
- More intuitive than traditional textbooks or classes.
- [Watch the playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab).
- This is mostly theory, so supplement with more formal resources.

#### Differential Equations (3Blue1Brown)
- Focuses on the geometric intuition of differential equations.
- The playlist is limited in scope but introduces useful concepts like Fourier transformations.
- [Watch the playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNPOjrT6KVlfJuKtYTftqH6).
- For better understanding of frequency analysis, watch [this video on uncertainty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBnnXbOM5S4).

#### Neural Networks (3Blue1Brown)
- Excellent visual explanation of how neural networks learn.
- Geometric interpretation of parameter spaces and network outputs.
- [Watch the playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi).

### Coding & Machine Learning

#### Introduction to Computer Science
- Covers fundamental concepts in CS.
- The entire course material is available online.
- [Access the course](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/twiki/bin/view/CS5/WebHome).

#### Data Structures and Algorithms
- Advanced, but useful for long-term learning.
- Includes GitHub-based grading system and tutorials.
- [Course materials on GitHub](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci046).

#### Fast.AI Courses
- Created by Jeremy Howard, designed for absolute beginners.
- Covers machine learning fundamentals, deep learning fundamentals, and advanced topics.
- Highly recommended to follow along with the coding exercises.
- Jupyter Notebooks and Anaconda/Miniconda are useful tools.
- GPU access can be obtained through Kaggle Notebooks or Google Colab.

#### Machine Learning with Andrew Ng
- A highly recommended introduction to machine learning theory.
- Available on platforms like Coursera.

#### Hands-on ML & Kaggle
- The hardest part of ML/DL is working with data.
- Kaggle is a great platform for finding datasets and testing ML/DL models.
- Learn these core libraries:
  - **NumPy**: Essential for numerical computing.
  - **Pandas**: Intuitive for handling datasets.
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
  - **Scikit-Learn**: Prebuilt ML models for easier implementation.
  - **PyTorch/Keras/TensorFlow**: Essential for deep learning.

#### Deep Learning From Scratch
- Reinforce your understanding by implementing neural networks manually.
- [Watch the tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk).
